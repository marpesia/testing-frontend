## The Exercise

The goal of the exercise is to create a list of test-takers (test-takers can be seen as users).

Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)
Create a component that enables you to load the data from the service created during step 1 and display the names of the test takers.


> Nice to have: The component should be reused to display other kinds of data.
